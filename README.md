# Toy Store Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing the overall performance of a multi-store toy retail chain to uncover actionable insights that could enhance both sales growth and inventory management. Leveraging Python for initial data exploration and in-depth analysis, the primary aim was to identify trends, optimize stock levels, product cost effectiveness and highlight performance across different products, categories and stores. Our final goal was to develop recommendations based on these insights, helping the business make strategic decisions to improve revenue and operational efficiency.
The analysis covered sales trend of two years and last quarter forecasts to compare the overall performance, effect on sales on weekdays and weekends, seasonality and product cost, and inventory distribution by city and category. Key metrics included average sales per day, inventory stock status, and the impact of stock thresholds, helping to distinguish overstocked items from those critically low on stock.
### Tools and Technologies 
Python and Power BI were used for different stages of the project. Python was employed to clean, transform, and integrate the raw dataset, enabling us to handle missing data, standardize formats, and make the data analysis-ready. We performed aggregations, created heatmaps, and developed preliminary as well as advance visualizations to assess patterns and insights.
Power BI was the tool of choice for creating an interactive dashboard. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was essential for creating calculated columns and measures, which helped in advanced calculations, such as filtering inventory levels and differentiating between top and bottom performers.
### Approach & Methodology
For this project, I used Python to perform all steps of data handling and visualization. The process began with data cleaning and integration to ensure consistency across datasets. Afterward, I moved to data extraction and transformationâ€”key steps to organize the data into actionable segments for analysis. Leveraging libraries like Pandas and Seaborn, I created comprehensive visualizations to uncover patterns such as sales variations by day and season, inventory distribution, and product performance.
In the final stages, Python also powered all visualizations for the final presentation, making complex insights accessible. Power BI was then used to develop an interactive dashboard, offering a user-friendly view of the analysis, ideal for ongoing stakeholder engagement.

### Key Insights 
#### Sales Distribution:
Sales activity was consistently higher during weekends, which could suggest that promotions or special weekend campaigns might be effective.
#### Product Performance:
 Certain toy categories significantly outperformed others.
####Stock Status Analysis:
 By applying stock thresholds, we identified overstocked items and those critically low in stock. Overstocks could lead to increased carrying costs, while critically low stock levels could cause missed sales opportunities.
#### Seasonal Demand Patterns: 
Certain product lines showed increased demand during specific seasons, suggesting an opportunity for targeted marketing efforts during these high-sales periods

### Recommendations 
1.	Implement Dynamic Pricing for Overstocked Items: This pricing strategy could help move excess inventory and reduce holding costs.
2.	Upselling and Cross-Selling Strategies: Offering complementary or higher-value items to customers could increase average order values. This strategy, especially during peak weekend sales, could maximize revenue. This strategy can also help us manage overstocked inventory.
3.	Enhanced Inventory Management: By expanding on top-performing product lines and ensuring critical items are restocked, the store could reduce out-of-stock situations and meet demand more effectively.
4.	Seasonal Marketing Campaigns: Promoting high-demand products in peak seasons could capitalize on seasonal demand fluctuations.
5.	Product Recommendations on Low-Stock Items: Proactively recommending alternatives when popular items are low in stock could mitigate lost sales.
